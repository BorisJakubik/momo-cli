## Description
This is a cli tool that I wrote to help generate a consistent structure when developing. This tool will allow you to generate functions with tests and an index.js file to export the function from the generated folder.

## Installation
```
$ npm i -g momo-cli
```
**note:** This package must be installed globally.

## Usage
Navigate to your folder of choice and run the `momo` command and answer all the questions.
